# Tic-Tac-Toe: Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning

This project implements the Tic-Tac-Toe game where an AI plays using:

- *The Minimax algorithm*
- *The Alpha-Beta Pruning optimization* of Minimax

The project compares the performance of both algorithms based on their average thinking time.

## How to Run

1. Open the .ipynb file in any compatible editor.
2. Run the code cells.
3. Player plays as 'O', while the AI plays as 'X'.
4. After one game with Minimax and one with Alpha-Beta, you will see a performance comparison.
